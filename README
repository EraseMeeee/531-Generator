# How to use

Make sure you have Powershell installed to use this script. I believe it is standard on Windows these days and there are instructions for installing on macos: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-7.1

- Make a copy of config/training-maxes.json.example and name it training-maxes.json. Be sure to keep your new copy in the config folder.
- Update the training-maxes.json file to reflect your training max for each of the lift. If you're not sure how to determine your training max, check out Jim's articles
- Decide which template in the templates folder you want to use
- The name of the template file (minus ".json") is what you will use to set the `TemplateName`
- For macos, run:
-- `pwsh New-531Sheet.ps1 -TemplateName fsl` (or bbb-beefcake)
- For Windows, I'm guessing:
-- `powershell New-531Sheet.ps1 -TemplateName fsl`
- Open the file generated in the "output" folder
- Either work from this view, or copy and paste the CSV contents into a Google Sheet
- Get swole
- Buy Jim's books :D
